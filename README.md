# RPS-Multiplayer

Multi-player game based on week 1 or 2 rock paper scissors game.  

I have done my best to make it mobile responsive. It can easiy be played on any mobile device.  

Two people can play at once, with any number of others who can observe the attacks. There is a drop down showing the names and stats of everyone currently connected to the site. Everyone can chat while they watch. 

Your name and stats are persistent on page re-load, but if you delete your name it wipes all of your stats as well.
