# RPS-Multiplayer

Multi-player game based on week 1 or 2 rock paper scissors game.  

This game allows for chat while you play.  

Two people can play at once, with any number of others who can observe the attacks. There is a drop down showing the names and stats of everyone currently connected to the site. 

Your name and stats are persistent on page re-load, but if you delete your name it wipes all of your stats as well.
